<h1>Nkata ndi Inyom Igbo — Website Rebuild</h1>
<p class="subtitle">High-Level Plan (Client-Facing)</p>

<h2>1. Vision</h2>
<p>Build a new, secure, and user-friendly website that reflects Nkata ndi Inyom Igbo’s mission: empowering Igbo women, preserving culture, and strengthening community. The site will feel modern and trustworthy, and support members with a bookshelf, video library, blog, and other tools.</p>

<h2>2. What We’re Building</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Area</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>New foundation</strong></td>
      <td>Full rebuild (no WordPress). Modern, fast, secure technology chosen for long-term reliability and ease of updates.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Bookshelf</strong></td>
      <td>Digital library of books and resources. Members browse by category, search, and read in-browser where applicable. Access can be public for some items and members-only for others.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Video library</strong></td>
      <td>Curated video library (cultural content, talks, events) powered by <strong>Mux</strong>. Members get a dedicated space to watch; playback is smooth and works well on mobile. We use Mux’s free tier to start (e.g. 10 videos, generous viewing minutes per month) and can scale as the library grows.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Blog</strong></td>
      <td>Blog for stories, cultural pieces, leadership advice, event recaps, and member spotlights. Easy for your team to publish and update, with support for Igbo and English if desired.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Member experience</strong></td>
      <td>Secure sign-up and login. Members get access to bookshelf and video library, and can see their own activity (e.g. saved or in-progress items) in a simple dashboard.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Additional features</strong></td>
      <td>Event listings and RSVP, clear donation/membership calls-to-action, site-wide search, and mobile-friendly design. We aim for strong accessibility so the site is usable for as many people as possible.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>3. Technology Choices (In Plain Terms)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Website platform:</strong> Next.js — fast, SEO-friendly, and well-suited for a content + member site.</li>
  <li><strong>Content management:</strong> A headless CMS (e.g. Strapi or Sanity) so your team can edit blog posts, book metadata, video descriptions, and events without touching code.</li>
  <li><strong>Video:</strong> Mux — professional streaming, reliable playback, and a free tier so we can launch the video library without upfront video hosting cost.</li>
  <li><strong>Hosting &amp; database:</strong> Industry-standard hosting (e.g. Vercel) and a managed database (e.g. PostgreSQL via Supabase) for users, memberships, and app data.</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> HTTPS everywhere, secure login, role-based access (e.g. public vs member), and no direct exposure of private media links.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Security &amp; Privacy</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All pages and forms served over HTTPS.</li>
  <li>Secure authentication and optional two-factor login for admins.</li>
  <li>Member-only areas (e.g. bookshelf, video library) protected so only logged-in members can access them.</li>
  <li>Video and premium content delivered through secure, time-limited links where applicable so they can’t be easily shared.</li>
  <li>Clear privacy and cookie practices, with room for a proper privacy policy and consent where required.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. User Experience Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Clear and welcoming</strong> — Homepage and key pages tell your story and make it obvious how to join, donate, or get involved.</li>
  <li><strong>Easy to use</strong> — Simple navigation, search, and filters so visitors and members can find blog posts, books, and videos quickly.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile-first</strong> — The site will be designed to work well on phones and tablets.</li>
  <li><strong>Inclusive</strong> — We’ll follow accessibility good practices so more people can use the site comfortably.</li>
  <li><strong>Fast and reliable</strong> — Quick load times and stable streaming so the site feels responsive and trustworthy.</li>
</ul>

      <td>Mux integration, video upload and metadata, member-only video pages, and a simple “continue watching” or list view.</td>

    </tr>
